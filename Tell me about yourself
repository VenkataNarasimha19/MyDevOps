Tell me about yourself:

"Good Morning/Evening, and thanks for your time. My name is Venkata Narasimha Rao, and I have over 12 years of IT experience, including 5 years of expertise in DevOps and cloud infrastructure and nearly 3 years as a Linux Administrator.

Currently, I am working as a Engineer - Lab Support at Moschip Technologies but working at client Qualcomm as DevOps Engineer, where my primary focus is on building and optimizing CI/CD pipelines, automating infrastructure provisioning using Terraform, Configuration management using Ansible and managing containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes. I work extensively with AWS services like EC2, VPC, IAM, and CloudWatch, ensuring that our cloud infrastructure is scalable, efficient, and cost-effective.

Prior to DevOps, I worked as a Linux Administrator for nearly 3 years, where I managed and optimized Linux-based systems for critical applications, ensuring high availability, security, and performance. During that time, I automated routine tasks using Ansible and shell scripting, reducing manual intervention and improving server uptime.

In addition to my Linux and DevOps work, I also have experience in test equipment calibration and remote support, providing networking support for test equipment and control machines, including firmware and firewall updates. I handled issues related to vulnerability remediation and managed system health, including the use of Nagios to monitor GPS Networking signals.

My career began as a GIS Engineer, where I spent 4 years working with geospatial technologies. Later, I transitioned to a Support Engineer role, troubleshooting test equipment for 1 year. These diverse roles have shaped my technical skills and problem-solving ability.

I'm passionate about driving automation and improving infrastructure scalability, and I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to streamline workflows. I believe my combined expertise in DevOps and Linux administration allows me to contribute effectively to optimizing system performance and delivering reliable solutions.

I'm looking forward to applying my skills in a challenging environment where I can contribute to cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps practices."
